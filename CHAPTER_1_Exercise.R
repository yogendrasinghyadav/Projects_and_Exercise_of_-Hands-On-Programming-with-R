#CHAPTER 1 > Exercise
# Thatâ€™s the basic interface for executing R code in RStudio. Think you have it? If so, try
# doing these simple tasks. If you execute everything correctly, you should end up with
# the same number that you started with:
# 1. Choose any number and add 2 to it.
# 2. Multiply the result by 3.
# 3. Subtract 6 from the answer.
# 4. Divide what you get by 3.
x <- 5
x <- x+2
x <- x*3
x <- x-6
x <- x/3
print(x)
